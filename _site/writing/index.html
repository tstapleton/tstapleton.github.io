<span class="post-meta">
	Aug 23, 2014
	<span class="separator"></span>
	<a href="/tags/development" rel="tag">development</a>
</span>

	<p class="post-lede">It is time for a new website. I built my last website in April 2012 in order to learn more about front-end development so I could get a new job. It was only a rethinking of what my resume could be in digital form, and didn’t really have a place to continually add content.

</p>

</li>

<span class="post-meta">
	Apr 13, 2012
	<span class="separator"></span>
	<a href="/tags/resume-site" rel="tag">resume-site</a>
</span>

	<p class="post-lede">Style Tiles are a way to communicate the visual design of a site without locking into a particular page layout. As the layout for a responsive website will change as the device width changes, we need a new way to communicate design that is separated from the layout.

</p>

</li>
	
		<li><h3><a class="post-link" href="/2012/04/12/responsive-framework.html">Responsive Framework</a></h3>
<span class="post-meta">
	Apr 12, 2012
	<span class="separator"></span>
	<a href="/tags/resume-site" rel="tag">resume-site</a>
</span>

	<p class="post-lede">Following the mobile strategy, the site will be designed for mobile devices first, and progressively enhanced as device resolution increases. The successful combination of a flexible grid-based layout, flexible images and media, and CSS3 media queries will produce a site that responds the user’s device.

</p>

</li>
	
		<li><h3><a class="post-link" href="/2012/04/11/mobile-strategy.html">Mobile Strategy</a></h3>
<span class="post-meta">
	Apr 11, 2012
	<span class="separator"></span>
	<a href="/tags/resume-site" rel="tag">resume-site</a>
</span>

	<p class="post-lede">As screen space is reduced on mobile devices, the content displayed should be the most important for the user to know and for the site to communicate. Often the user’s time and attention are limited in mobile situations, but given the common saying that traditional resumes have about 30 seconds to make an impression, competing for the user’s focus is already accepted.

</p>

	<span class="separator"></span>
	<a href="/tags/resume-site" rel="tag">resume-site</a>
</span>

	<p class="post-lede">Erin explains that the purpose of user research is to discover what your readers really want and need. My users are potential employers looking for front-end web developers, preferably those with consumers as their end users (versus working on a line-of-business web app), and who value design and user experience.

</p>

<span class="post-meta">
	Apr 9, 2012
	<span class="separator"></span>
	<a href="/tags/resume-site" rel="tag">resume-site</a>
</span>

	<p class="post-lede">The primary message that should be conveyed to potential employers is that I will be able to provide value to their organization, that I can figure out how to solve problems and then deliver results.

</p>

	<span class="separator"></span>
	<a href="/tags/resume-site" rel="tag">resume-site</a>
</span>

	<p class="post-lede">I find that I learn best through application. In school, I was always good math, largely, I believe, because of the repetition of problems in the homework sets. I was able to learn about a topic, and then practice how that topic is applied to problems. This project, I hope, will give me the opportunity to learn about new ideas in web development, and apply them to a problem.
