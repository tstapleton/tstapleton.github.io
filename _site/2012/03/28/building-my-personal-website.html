		<p>I find that I learn best through application. In school, I was always good math, largely, I believe, because of the repetition of problems in the homework sets. I was able to learn about a topic, and then practice how that topic is applied to problems. This project, I hope, will give me the opportunity to learn about new ideas in web development, and apply them to a problem.</p>

<p>My goal is to get a job as a front-end developer. The problem is solving how to demonstrate that I will be valuable to a new organization. And I will use this project as a way to highlight what I have done in the past, and, probably more importantly, document how I go about solving a problem.</p>

<p>I am going to build a website that will act as my resume and write about my thinking process as I work on it. At the end, I will have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An updated resume to show my accomplishments and projects in a more appealing format than a text document</li>
  <li>The website itself to be used as a recent code sample and a topic to discuss design decisions during an interview</li>
  <li>This journal to demonstrate the way I think about solving problems</li>
</ul>

<p>And I want to learn about - and apply - some of the new ideas and technologies, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mobile first, popularized by Luke Wroblewski</li>
  <li>Responsive web design, popularized by Ethan Marcotte</li>
  <li>Developing for touch on mobile devices</li>
  <li>HTML5 and semantic markup</li>
  <li>CSS3</li>
  <li>jQuery</li>
  <li>Using git properly and hosting code on github</li>
  <li>Responsive images</li>
  <li>Compass/SASS/LESS</li>
  <li>Setting up a better development workflow - using new tools, shortcuts, apps, open source libraries, etc</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-will-i-do-it">How will I do it?</h2>

<p>From a high level, I can separate the project into various parts:</p>

<h3 id="content">Content</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Updating my resume and collecting artifacts for demonstration, being inclusive of everything</li>
  <li>Determining the model - a node might have a date, one or more pictures, an organization, text, links, categorization</li>
  <li>Determining how to categorize the content - traditional resumes generally segregate by employer, other possibilities could be by time or by importance</li>
  <li>Curating - determining what content isn’t really necessary</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="site-structure">Site Structure</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Implementing the responsive framework - how the site, as a whole, goes from mobile to desktop</li>
  <li>Implementing responsive content - deciding how the content will differ from mobile to desktop, or even if it should</li>
  <li>Building the markup for the content</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="user-interface">User Interface</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Deciding how a potential employer will interact with the content</li>
  <li>Visual styles for the content</li>
  <li>Implementing touch interactions</li>
  <li>Making sure the design and content makes sense on phones, tablets and desktops</li>
</ul>

<p>For the actual doing part of the project, I’m going to start off by reading <em><a href="http://www.lukew.com/resources/mobile_first.asp">Mobile First</a></em> by Luke WroblewskI because I think it will focus more on the strategy part of the project, in terms of how to treat content and how to think about the site from a high level, which should guide my plan for the rest of the project. I will be taking notes on what I read, and detailing how the ideas could apply to this project.</p>
