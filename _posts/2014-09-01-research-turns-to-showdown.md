I started doing some research on how to make a great Bloody Mary. I want to figure out how I can make a better Bloody Mary, how I can simplify the process of making a Bloody Mary at home, and some techniques to make my Bloody Mary more interesting.

The Bloody Mary has so many variations and everyone thinks they have *The Best* Bloody Mary. I prefer traditional ones - meaning vodka, tomato juice and some heat. [Serious Eats][seriouseats] identifies the components pretty well:

* Base spirit - vodka.
* Tomato juice - a savory, sweet and slightly tart base.
* Savory additives - salt and savory flavors, like Worcestershire.
* Spice - a pepper component, and possibly some herbs.
* Burn - hot peppers, chilies, and horseradish.
* Acid - lemon and lime juice, likely proportionate to the amount of tomato juice
* Aromatic garnish - classically a celery stick.

I was looking for the science behind the drink - what makes a drink *great*. [Research][chemistry] presented at a meeting of the American Chemical Society listed some factors in a great Bloody Mary:

> * Make it fresh. Chemically, the Bloody Mary is a "highly unstable" concoction, and the quality tends to deteriorate quickly.
> * Ice it up. Serving Bloody Marys on ice helps to slow down the chemical reactions involving acids in tomato juice and other ingredients that degrade the taste.
> * Mind your mixes. If you use a cocktail mix, add some fresh ingredients to enhance the flavor and aroma.
> * Splurge on the juice. Tomato juice makes up most of the Bloody Maryâ€™s volume, so use high quality juice that has a deep, rich flavor.
> * Economize on the vodka. The intense, spicy flavor of a Bloody Mary masks the vodka, and using premium vodka makes little sense.

It seems obvious that fresh ingredients would produce the best product. This doesn't help for being able to create a bulk mix in advance, but I still hope an partial mix could be created. I imagine a spice mixture created in bulk in advance, then combine it with vodka and tomato juice to produce a quick Bloody Mary.

I've also only used packaged tomato juice and V8. Cambell's Spicy V8 works pretty well because it contains a lot of flavor in addition to the tomato juice base, but I'm now thinking that finding a good quality tomato juice, and increasing the added components, is worth a try.

Further research can be categorized into recipes and components.

#### Recipes

* [The Ultimate Fully-Loaded Bloody Mary][bmserious] - a traditional recipe with ingredient quantities to use as a baseline, and includes soy sauce
* [The Best Bloody Mary Recipe][bmbest] - a traditional recipe with ingredient quantities to use as a baseline, with a point to rest the ingredients in the refrigerator
* [The Dirty Mary][saveur] - heavy on the pickle, lemon and *fresh* horseradish
* [Grey Goose Mediterranean Mary][bmmediterranean] - interesting mix with tomato juice, olive tapenade and herbs
* [Elixir Bloody Mary][bmelixir] - focus on seasonings, with some spice
* [The Best Bloody Mary][bmbonappetit] - homemade tomato juice and mostly fresh ingredients
* [Chi-Dog Juice][foxnews] - homemade tomato juice, inspired by a Chicago hot dog
* [Shanghai Surprise][foxnews] - lots of heat with an Asian twist

#### Components

* [Pepper infused vodka][peppervodka]
* [Tomato-chili ice cubes][tomatoicecubes]
* [Quality pickles][pickles]
* [Freezing the ingredients][popsicles]
* [Bloody Mary ice cubes][icecubes]
* [Homemade Worcestershire sauce][worcestershire]
* Old Bay Seasoning
* Freshly grated horseradish
* [Pickle infused vodka][saveur]

I'm thinking the next step for this project is a showdown between each of the recipes with [my personal recipe]({% post_url 2014-09-01-origin-of-my-bloody-mary-recipe %}). Since many of the recipes ask for high-quality tomato juice, I'll need to find that first.

Then I'll start tweaking my recipe based on what I discovered during the showdowns.
