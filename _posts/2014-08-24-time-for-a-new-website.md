It is time for a new website. I built my last website in April 2012 in order to learn more about front-end development so I could get a new job. It was only a rethinking of what my resume could be in digital form, and didn't really have a place to continually add content.

So I'll start fresh. I'll be using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with [GitHubPages](https://pages.github.com/).

I hope this becomes a place where I can write more because I learn so much by writing. I want to be able to look back on what I had written in the past to see what I was thinking and how I was solving problems at the time. I'm happy I spent the time [documenting my thinking](/tags/resume-site) in building the first version of my site, it was interesting reading it again as I've been porting over the content.

I hope this becomes a place where I can collect my side projects. I used to do a lot of web development on the side - mainly [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com/) themes and [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) websites. I had an outlet to explore new technologies on a variety of different projects, and I was able to showcase them publically. Most of my work now is internal to [Tradeshift](http://tradeshift.com/) and I really haven't spent much time on side projects recently. Rebuilding this site will be the first of the new side projects.
