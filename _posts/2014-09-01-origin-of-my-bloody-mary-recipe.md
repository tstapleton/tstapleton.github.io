My dad got me introduced me to The Bloody Mary. He made the first one I ever had during a Christmas vacation at home from college. I was hooked since that first drink, and I even remember making the second round for us shortly after finishing the first.

My dad's recipe is traditional. There isn't anything fancy and it can be made pretty quickly.

### My Dad's Bloody Mary

#### Ingredients

* Cambell's tomato juice
* Stolichnaya vodka
* Lemon juice
* Worcestershire
* Tobasco brand hot sauce
* Celery salt
* Black pepper
* Celery stalk for garnish

#### Steps

1. Add ice to a glass.
2. Add all ingredients.
3. Mix with the celery stalk.

I started building on this recipe to get more flavor and add more heat. After many iterations and adjustments, I'm pretty happy with the resulting drink now.

### My Bloody Mary, August 2014

#### Ingredients

* Cambell's spicy V8 juice
* Stolichnaya or Absolut vodka
* Lemon juice or (lime juice if we don't have lemons)
* Worcestershire
* Cholula brand hot sauce
* Celery salt
* Fresh ground black pepper
* Horseradish
* Pickle brine
* Olive brine
* Pickle slices or olives soaking in the drink to eat afterwards

#### Steps

1. Add lemon, Worcestershire, Cholula, celery salt, black pepper, horseradish, pickle brine, olive brine to a glass. Mix.
2. Add vodka. Mix.
3. Add pickle slices or olives.
4. Add ice cubes.
5. Fill with spicy V8. Mix.

Although I really like this drink, I still have three complaints:

* Almost everything is packaged and store bought. Nothing is home made, and the only fresh ingredient is the lemon or lime, which even then is often packaged.
* Assembly is time consuming. Every ingredient is added to each drink independently - and there are a lot of ingredients currently.
* The drink is slightly different every time since I don't measure the ingredients. Which also means that I don't know the optimal measurement of ingredients.

So I'm going to figure out how to improve it. I want to:

* Find ways to make ingredients from scratch for special occasions
* Test my variation against other recipes claiming to be *the best*
* Find a way to make a drink with less components - either by eliminating unnecessary components or by assembling a mixture of ingredients that can be stored and used as needed

And I'll be collecting [my findings](/tags/bloody-mary/) as I go.
