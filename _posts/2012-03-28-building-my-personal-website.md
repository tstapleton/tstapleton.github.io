I find that I learn best through application. In school, I was always good math, largely, I believe, because of the repetition of problems in the homework sets. I was able to learn about a topic, and then practice how that topic is applied to problems. This project, I hope, will give me the opportunity to learn about new ideas in web development, and apply them to a problem.

My goal is to get a job as a front-end developer. The problem is solving how to demonstrate that I will be valuable to a new organization. And I will use this project as a way to highlight what I have done in the past, and, probably more importantly, document how I go about solving a problem.

I am going to build a website that will act as my resume and write about my thinking process as I work on it. At the end, I will have:

* An updated resume to show my accomplishments and projects in a more appealing format than a text document
* The website itself to be used as a recent code sample and a topic to discuss design decisions during an interview
* This journal to demonstrate the way I think about solving problems

And I want to learn about - and apply - some of the new ideas and technologies, including:

* Mobile first, popularized by Luke Wroblewski
* Responsive web design, popularized by Ethan Marcotte
* Developing for touch on mobile devices
* HTML5 and semantic markup
* CSS3
* jQuery
* Using git properly and hosting code on github
* Responsive images
* Compass/SASS/LESS
* Setting up a better development workflow - using new tools, shortcuts, apps, open source libraries, etc

## How will I do it?

From a high level, I can separate the project into various parts:

### Content

* Updating my resume and collecting artifacts for demonstration, being inclusive of everything
* Determining the model - a node might have a date, one or more pictures, an organization, text, links, categorization
* Determining how to categorize the content - traditional resumes generally segregate by employer, other possibilities could be by time or by importance
* Curating - determining what content isn't really necessary

### Site Structure

* Implementing the responsive framework - how the site, as a whole, goes from mobile to desktop
* Implementing responsive content - deciding how the content will differ from mobile to desktop, or even if it should
* Building the markup for the content

### User Interface

* Deciding how a potential employer will interact with the content
* Visual styles for the content
* Implementing touch interactions
* Making sure the design and content makes sense on phones, tablets and desktops

For the actual doing part of the project, I'm going to start off by reading *[Mobile First](http://www.lukew.com/resources/mobile_first.asp)* by Luke WroblewskI because I think it will focus more on the strategy part of the project, in terms of how to treat content and how to think about the site from a high level, which should guide my plan for the rest of the project. I will be taking notes on what I read, and detailing how the ideas could apply to this project.
